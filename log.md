## 1. Lets first understand the conways game of life

- we follow these basic rules for each cell
1. Any live cell with <b> fewer than two live neighbors dies</b>, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with <b>two or three live neighbors lives on</b> to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with <b>more than three live neighbors dies</b>, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with <b>exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell</b>, as if by reproduction.
